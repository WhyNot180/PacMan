## Why Make This?

This replica has been created in order to demonstrate Object-Oriented-Programming. Additionally, this was created partly as a challenge of our programming skills.

## Installation

Currently, the game is still in development and requires [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed in order to run.

Additionally, pygame is also required. In order to install pygame you need to go to the terminal and type the following **after python is installed**:

Windows:
```
pip pygame
```

MacOS:
```
pip3 pygame
```

Once both are installed you can run the game by typing in the terminal in the folder where the game is located:
```
python Main.py
```
